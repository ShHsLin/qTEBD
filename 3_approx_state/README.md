# qTEBD

qTEBD is the algorithm for real or imaginary time evolution by fidelity maximization. We benchmark such algorithm on MPS for ground state search and quench problem. Then, we show that the algorithm can be generalized to classical simulation of quantum circuit.


### Requirement

numpy, jax, (TeNPy)
